Overview
========
Expyriment is an open-source and platform independent light-weight Python 
library for designing and conducting timing-critical behavioural and 
neuroimaging experiments. The major goal is to provide a well-structured Python 
library for a script-based experiment development with a high priority on the 
readability of the resulting programme code. It has been tested extensively 
under Linux and Windows.

Expyriment is an all-in-one solution, as it handles the stimulus presentation, 
recording of I/O events, communication with other devices and the collection 
and preprocessing of data. It offers furthermore a hierarchical design 
structure, which allows an intuitive transition from the experimental design to 
a running programme. It is therefore also suited for students as well as 
experimental psychologists and neuroscientists with little programming 
experience.
