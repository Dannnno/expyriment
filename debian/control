Description: A Python library for cognitive and neuroscientific experiments
   Expyriment is an open-source and platform independent light-weight Python
   library for designing and conducting timing-critical behavioural and 
   neuroimaging experiments. The major goal is to provide a well-structured 
   Python library for a script-based experiment development with a high 
   priority on the readability of the resulting programme code.
